## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

**CRITICAL:** Read [TESTING_CHECKLIST.md](TESTING_CHECKLIST.md) before your first push.

### Quick Testing (Every Commit)
```powershell
# Automated validation
.\scripts\validate_before_push.ps1 -SkipUI
```

### Full Testing (Before Push)
```powershell
# Full validation including UI test prompts
.\scripts\validate_before_push.ps1
```

### Manual UI Testing
1. Launch `build\Release\RvrseMonitorApp.exe`
2. Click "Refresh" - process list updates
3. Double-click a process - modules dialog opens
4. Click "Handles..." - handles list populates
5. Check CPU/Memory graphs animate smoothly

**If ANY test fails, DO NOT PUSH. Fix the issue first.**

---

## 🐛 Debugging Tips

### Build Errors
- **"Cannot find msbuild.exe"**
  ```powershell
  $env:PATH = "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\MSBuild\Current\Bin;" + $env:PATH
  ```

- **"Unresolved external symbol"**
  - Check that all `.cpp` files are included in `RvrseCore.vcxproj`
  - Verify linker settings in project properties

### Runtime Errors
- **"Access Denied" when opening process**
  - Run as Administrator for full system access
  - Some protected processes (System, Registry) require kernel driver

- **Crash on startup**
  - Run from Visual Studio debugger (F5)
  - Check Event Viewer for application crashes
  - Verify all dependencies are present

### Performance Issues
- **ProcessSnapshot taking >10ms**
  - You likely added synchronous I/O or expensive operations
  - Profile with telemetry: Check `telemetry_*.json`
  - Use Visual Studio Profiler for deep analysis

### UI Glitches
- **Window not responding**
  - Check for blocking calls on UI thread
  - Move expensive operations to background threads
  - Use `InvalidateRect()` for asynchronous UI updates

## 📦 Dependencies & APIs

### Windows APIs Used
- **Process Management:** `NtQuerySystemInformation`, `OpenProcess`, `EnumProcessModules`
- **Handle Enumeration:** `NtQuerySystemInformation(SystemHandleInformation)`
- **Network:** `GetExtendedTcpTable`, `GetExtendedUdpTable` (iphlpapi.h)
- **Driver Communication:** `CreateFile`, `DeviceIoControl`
- **UI:** Win32 API (CreateWindow, GDI for graphs)

### Third-Party Libraries
- None currently (pure Win32/WDM)
- All dependencies are Windows SDK APIs

---

## 🔐 Security & Best Practices

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] No hardcoded passwords/API keys
- [ ] No unbounded loops or recursion
- [ ] Proper error handling (check return values)
- [ ] No memory leaks (use RAII, smart pointers where possible)
- [ ] Input validation for user-provided data
- [ ] Buffer overflow protection (`wcsncpy_s` instead of `wcscpy`)

### Sensitive Operations
- **Administrator privileges:** Required for full process access
- **Kernel driver:** Requires code signing, test signing mode, or local debugging
- **Performance:** Avoid O(n²) algorithms in hot paths (snapshot code)

### Git Hygiene
- **DO NOT commit:**
  - Personal paths (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\...`)
  - Large binaries (>10 MB)
  - `.env` files with secrets
  - Temporary files (`*.tmp`, `*.log`)
  - Build artifacts (`build/`, `dist/`)

- **DO commit:**
  - Source code (`.cpp`, `.h`)
  - Project files (`.vcxproj`, `.sln`)
  - Documentation (`.md`)
  - Scripts (`.ps1`, `.cmd`)

## 🆘 Getting Help

### Common Questions
1. **"How do I add a new feature?"**
   - Read `docs/design/system-monitor-architecture.md`
   - Check existing similar features (e.g., `process_snapshot.cpp`)
   - Ask in team chat before starting

2. **"My change broke a test, now what?"**
   - Read the test failure message carefully
   - Run the specific test in isolation
   - If you can't fix it, revert your change and ask for help

3. **"Can I work on the driver?"**
   - Driver work requires local testing (admin + signing)
   - Focus on usermode features remotely via Claude Code
   - Coordinate with office PC for driver validation
